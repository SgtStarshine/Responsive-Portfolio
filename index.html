              <p>Aside from my fascination for video games, computers, coding and animation, there's not much else about me that I feel the need to speak about. I like to think of myself as sharp-witted and clever, but I have never been told or talked about concerning those traits of mine. In fact, this part about writing about myself, or typing in this instance, is the hardest thing I found about this assignment, even after the amount of mental gymnastics I had to perform to get this site to look how it looks now.</p>
